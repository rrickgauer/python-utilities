# python-utilities
This is my personal python utilities library that I made so that I can quickly access it from anywhere if needed. This is a work in progress so I will be updating as the time comes.

## Requirements
The Utilities class uses a module called [BeautifulTable](https://github.com/pri22296/beautifultable).
```
pip install beautifultable
```

## Installation
In the terminal, navigate to your working directory and enter:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrickgauer/python-utilities/master/Utilities.py
```

Then, in your python script add the following line of code:
```python
from Utilities import Utilities as util
```

From here, you can call any of the functions by using ```util.function_name()```
